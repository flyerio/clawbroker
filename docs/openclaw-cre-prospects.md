# CRE Professionals Discussing OpenClaw — Full Report

**Date compiled:** February 18–19, 2026

---

## INSTRUCTIONS (Do Not Delete)

- **Goal: 500 CRE professionals** who have publicly discussed OpenClaw
- **Every person MUST have a LinkedIn URL** — find and include `linkedin.com/in/xxx` for each entry
- **CRE ONLY** — commercial real estate: office, retail, industrial, multifamily (as investment), hospitality, self-storage, data centers, mixed-use, land development, net lease, medical office, etc.
- **No residential-only agents** — exclude purely residential real estate agents/brokers unless they also do commercial
- **Data per person:** Name, LinkedIn URL, platform where they discussed OpenClaw, CRE role, company, summary of what they said, link to source post

## Executive Summary

OpenClaw (formerly Clawdbot/Moltbot) launched in late January 2026 and went viral with 180,000+ GitHub stars. **Target: 500 CRE professionals.** Currently tracking **~128 unique individuals** (CRE-only, audited) across two categories:

1. **~79 CRE professionals who specifically discussed OpenClaw** (LinkedIn, Twitter, Reddit, Substack, podcasts, blogs, Instagram, GoHighLevel)
2. **~49 CRE AI Early Adopters** — conference speakers, community leaders, and proptech founders publicly active in AI adoption at NAIOP, Bisnow, CREtech, IMN, Adventures in CRE/AI.Edge, and major brokerages (high-value outreach targets)

**CRE audit (Feb 19):** 16 residential-only entries removed (residential agents, home hunters, Zillow lead gen, home renovation). All remaining entries are CRE: office, retail, industrial, multifamily (investment), hospitality, self-storage, data centers, net lease, mixed-use, property management, mortgage/lending, or builders specifically targeting CRE clients.

**Key insight:** The CRE + OpenClaw conversation is concentrated in a small number of high-influence nodes. LinkedIn is by far the richest source. Twitter's "CoStar replacement" thread (originated by @TheMotelMan) is the highest-engagement CRE + OpenClaw conversation found. The broader CRE AI community (~500+ in AI for CRE Collective, 700+ at Spencer Burton's workshops) represents a large pipeline of professionals likely to adopt OpenClaw as it matures.

**Reality check:** After exhaustive searches across 40+ agents running 700+ queries, the CRE + OpenClaw overlap is extremely thin at this 3-week mark. The 500-person target is not achievable from public data alone — the ~79 direct discussants here represent essentially the full publicly discoverable CRE universe as of Feb 19, 2026.

## Search Coverage Report

| Metric | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Research agents deployed** | 40+ |
| **Total queries executed** | 700+ |
| **Direct CRE discussants found** | 79 |
| **CRE AI early adopters found** | 49 |
| **Total unique prospects** | ~128 |
| **Key constraint** | OpenClaw only ~3 weeks old; CRE is niche within the broader AI conversation |

### Platforms Fully Exhausted

- **LinkedIn:** All 40 pages of "OpenClaw" search results scraped and processed
- **Twitter/X:** Full search results + Adam Smith thread (79K views) + all quote tweets of Moses Kagan, Daniel Foch, and Michael Bowie
- **Reddit:** r/commercialrealestate, r/realestateinvesting, r/realestate — zero OpenClaw posts found
- **Video/Social:** YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Facebook — minimal CRE-specific OpenClaw content
- **Long-form:** Medium, Substack, BiggerPockets, Blogs — Rob Hahn and Topher Stephenson only substantive CRE writers
- **Communities:** Skool, Discord, WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Hacker News, Quora — no CRE-specific OpenClaw discussions
- **Product/Dev:** ProductHunt, GitHub — no CRE-focused OpenClaw tools found
- **CRE Trade Publications:** Bisnow, GlobeSt, CCIM, Adventures in CRE, Crexi — one Bisnow article (Topher Stephenson), no others

### What Could Surface More Prospects

- **Time/maturity:** OpenClaw is 3 weeks old. CRE adoption will grow as the product matures.
- **Private communities:** CRE Slack groups, private Discord servers, mastermind groups are not publicly searchable.
- **CRE conferences:** ICSC, CCIM Institute, CRE.Converge, Blueprint — in-person conversations not captured online.
- **LinkedIn Sales Navigator:** Paid tool enables deeper filtering beyond the 40-page public search limit.
- **Direct outreach responses:** Many CRE professionals will discover OpenClaw through the outreach this list enables.

### Conclusion

**79 direct CRE discussants is the current ceiling from publicly discoverable data.** The remaining 49 CRE AI early adopters are high-probability prospects based on their public AI adoption activity at CRE conferences and communities. Further growth requires time, product maturity, and direct outreach.

---

## Limitations & Context

- OpenClaw launched only ~3 weeks ago (late January 2026). CRE adoption is extremely early-stage.
- **CRE-only audit completed Feb 19:** 16 residential-only entries removed. Remaining list is strictly commercial RE.
- LinkedIn content is heavily gated — deeper pages may contain additional leads.
- Reddit's RE subreddits (r/realestateinvesting, r/commercialrealestate, r/realestate) have **zero** OpenClaw posts.
- X/Twitter requires login for full content — some leads may be missed.
- Major CRE organizations (CCIM, SIOR, ICSC, NAIOP, ULI) have **not** mentioned OpenClaw in any public communications.
- Major CRE brokerages (Cushman & Wakefield, CBRE, JLL, Newmark, Marcus & Millichap, Colliers) — no employee posts found discussing OpenClaw.
- BiggerPockets, Adventures in CRE, Tyler Cauble — no OpenClaw mentions found.
- OpenClaw Discord/Slack, Skool RE communities, Medium — no CRE-specific discussions found.
- The "CRE AI Early Adopters" section includes professionals who are publicly active in AI adoption at CRE conferences and communities — they are high-value outreach targets even if they haven't specifically posted about OpenClaw yet.
